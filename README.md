# Casimir-programming
This repository is used during the Casimir programming course, to introduce version control using git. The following files are part of the repository:

## test.py
This file was made on a local system, and (ultimately) contains a print statement, as well as functions to compute the circumference and area of a circle, given their radii.
   
## test_2.py
This file was made on GitHub, to illustrate the necessity of pulling repositories. Contains a print statement
   
## script.py
This file is also made on a local system, to practice with version control. Imports test.py and subsequently computes and prints the circumference and area of a circle with radius 2.
